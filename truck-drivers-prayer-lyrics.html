                    <p align="justify">We pray that our country’s situation will soon pass with your divine help. According to fmcsa, safety should be every trucker’s must. Much like truck drivers can find solace in the road, the road can find companionship with its travelers. Many who were employed as professional drivers are now unemployed and looking for work. Keep him safe and healthy.</p>
